        Hola! I'm Nur. A Front-end Developer working remotely from Dhaka,
        Bangladesh.

        I've spent most of my last waking hours for the last 2 years in learning
        and developing cool but practical user interfaces for websites.

        As a passionate front-end React developer, I thrive on crafting
        exceptional user experiences through clean and efficient code. With a
        deep understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I specialize in
        building dynamic and responsive web applications. Equipped with strong
        problem-solving skills, I continuously strive to stay updated with the
        latest front-end technologies and best practices. Whether it's

        As a React frontend developer I'm comfortable at building dynamic UIs
        and JavaScript (ES6+), coupled with Redux for state management in larger
        apps. Other tools include Axios for API calls, and testing libraries
        like Jest for ensuring code quality.
